Project Proposal: Ditgital Catalogue of Historic Mineral Exploration Data in Newfoundland and Labrador

Author: Chris Williams

Synopsis

Since the 1970's the Government of NL has done a good job collecting and cataloguing historic assessment reports from companies spending money exploring for minerals in Newfoundland and Labrador. Utilizing historic exploration data enables efficent exploration today with lesser environmental impact and may expedite discoveries. However, much of this data is locked in PDFs requiring expensive third party digitization and/or time-consunming report reading by geologsits. Unfortunately due to pressures (investors, personnel, operations, ect.) on junior exploration compaines historic data may be overlooked. This will not only lead to inefficencies in exploration, but may also result unnecessary environmental impact by unknowingly duplicating surveys. These historic reports may also point towards "cirtical minerals" that were not sought after historically, but should be an emphasis in todays transitory economy.

GetCoding Project

This is a complex and import problem to solve, and I envision it in multiple stages. In the context of my GetCoding program, I wish to produce a GIS web based applicaiton able to display current and historic mining claims in NL. This application should be able to filter different mining claims by date, locaiton, company, ect. The government of NL has a similar applicaiton at: https://geoatlas.gov.nl.ca/Default.htm with much more information historic mining leases. To differentiate my applicaiton I want a list of what work was done in each license and ultimately have accessible digital data avaliable.

Incorporating Company Financial Data

I think that incorporating company financial information for the investor is another useful functionality than can be incoporated into this project. There are some websites that track junior mining companies share prices (i.e https://www.juniorminingnetwork.com/) but I would personnal perfer looking at this sort of data in map view or on a GIS based web appliation.
