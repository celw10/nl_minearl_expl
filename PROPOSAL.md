Project Proposal: Ditgital Catalogue of Historic Mineral Exploration Data in Newfoundland and Labrador

Author: Chris Williams

Synopsis

Since the 1970's the Government of NL has done a good job collecting and cataloguing historic assessment reports from companies spending money exploring for minerals in Newfoundland and Labrador. Utilizing historic exploration data enables efficent exploration today with lesser environmental impact and may expedite discoveries. However, much of this data is locked in PDFs requiring expensive third party digitization and/or time-consunming research and report reading by geologsits. Unfortunately due to pressures (investors, personnel, ect.) on Junior Exploration Compaines operating on the island this historic data may be overlooked. This will not only lead to inefficencies in exploration, but may also result in the duplicaton of some surveys resulting in unnecessary environmental impacts. These historic reports may also point towards "cirtical minerals" that were not sought after historically, but should be an emphasis in todays transitory economy.

GetCoding Project

This is a complex and import problem to solve, and I envision it in multiple stages. For the context of my GetCoding program, I envision a GIS web based applicaiton able to display historic mining claims in NL. This application should be able to filter different mining claims by date, locaiton, company, ect. The government of NL has a similar applicaiton at: https://geoatlas.gov.nl.ca/Default.htm. However, there is much more information contained in this application than historic mining leases.

Following steps should reult in cataloguing what data is collected within each historic company license, and ultimately digital data avaliable for download. I think for now setting up the GIS based web applicaiton is a reasonable goal to start this program. Other steps will become complex with non-digital sanned PDFs, but successfully getting tabular data out of these PDFs will be increadibly beneficial. 

Incorporating Company Financial Data

I think that it would also be beneficial to include financial information (i.e. market cap, share price) of mining companies spatially (i.e. bound to their mining claims). This could be a cool feature to implement as well once the GIS applicaiton is setup. There are some websites that track junior mining companies share prices (i.e https://www.juniorminingnetwork.com/) but I would personnal perfer looking at this sort of data in map view or on a GIS based web appliation.
